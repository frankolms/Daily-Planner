# Daily-Planner

This is a daily work day planner that helps you schedule out your day from 9AM to 5PM. If it is currently anytime between 9AM and 5PM, that corresponding hour block will be highlighted as red. Any future hour block before 5PM will be highlighted as green. For example, if it is currently 2PM, the hour blocks for 3PM - 5PM will all be highlighted as green. If it is anytime after 9AM all of those past hour blocks will be highlighted as gray. If it is currently 12PM, all hour blocks from 9AM - 11AM will be highlighted as gray. You can type out all of your tasks in each hour block and then click the save button. All of your tasks will be saved in local storage, and those tasks will persist in those hour blocks until they are erased by the user or erased from local storage.
